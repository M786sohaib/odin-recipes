      <p class="description">
        <strong>Hyderabadi Mutton Dum Biryani</strong> is a flavorful, aromatic
        rice dish from Hyderabad, India. It consists of tender marinated mutton
        (goat or lamb) cooked with basmati rice, yogurt, and a blend of spices
        like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. The "dum" cooking method involves
        slow-cooking the dish in a sealed pot to retain moisture and enhance the
        flavors. It's often served with raita, salad, or boiled eggs, making it
        a rich, hearty meal.

      <ol class="directions">
        <li>
          Marinate the mutton: Mix yogurt, ginger, garlic, green chilies, and
          spices (cumin, coriander, cloves, cardamom, garam masala). Marinate
          the mutton for at least 1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Prepare the rice: Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. Cook it
          in boiling water with bay leaves and a pinch of salt, but keep it
          slightly undercooked (parboiled).
        </li>
        <li>
          Fry the onions: Slice onions thinly and fry in ghee/oil until golden
          brown. Reserve some fried onions for garnish.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the mutton: In a large pot, heat ghee/oil. Add marinated mutton
          and cook until the mutton is tender and the oil separates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Layer the biryani: In a large pot, layer the parboiled rice and cooked
          mutton alternately. Top with fried onions, fresh cilantro, mint, and
          saffron-infused milk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Dum cooking: Seal the pot with dough or a lid. Cook on low heat for
          20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
        </li>
        <li>Serve: Fluff the biryani and serve hot with raita or a salad.</li>
