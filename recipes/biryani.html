    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Hyderabadi Mutton Dum Biryani</strong> is a flavorful, aromatic
      rice dish from Hyderabad, India. It consists of tender marinated mutton
      (goat or lamb) cooked with basmati rice, yogurt, and a blend of spices
      like saffron, cardamom, and cloves. The "dum" cooking method involves
      slow-cooking the dish in a sealed pot to retain moisture and enhance the
      flavors. It's often served with raita, salad, or boiled eggs, making it a
      rich, hearty meal.

    <h2>Cooking Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Marinate the mutton: Mix yogurt, ginger, garlic, green chilies, and
        spices (cumin, coriander, cloves, cardamom, garam masala). Marinate the
        mutton for at least 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the rice: Wash and soak basmati rice for 30 minutes. Cook it in
        boiling water with bay leaves and a pinch of salt, but keep it slightly
        undercooked (parboiled).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the onions: Slice onions thinly and fry in ghee/oil until golden
        brown. Reserve some fried onions for garnish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the mutton: In a large pot, heat ghee/oil. Add marinated mutton and
        cook until the mutton is tender and the oil separates.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer the biryani: In a large pot, layer the parboiled rice and cooked
        mutton alternately. Top with fried onions, fresh cilantro, mint, and
        saffron-infused milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dum cooking: Seal the pot with dough or a lid. Cook on low heat for
        20-30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
      </li>
      <li>Serve: Fluff the biryani and serve hot with raita or a salad.</li>
